# Next.js Dashboard Project

## Overview
This is a **full-stack dashboard application** built using **Next.js**. The main goal of this project is to **enhance my Next.js skills** by working on a structured and functional application. As I am new to Next.js, I am experimenting with different features of the framework to get a strong grip on it.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS (or any other UI library)
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (or a separate backend if needed)

## Features (Planned)
- User Authentication
- Data Visualization (Charts, Tables, Stats)
- Role-based Access Control
- API Integration for Dynamic Data
- Responsive UI

## Project Setup
To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>

# Navigate into the project directory
cd nextjs-dashboard

# Install dependencies
yarn install  # or npm install
```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
yarn dev  # or npm run dev
```
This will start the Next.js development server on **http://localhost:3000/**.
